principles:
  - name: "Bilingual Structure (双语结构)"
    rule: "Use English for Headers, IDs, Terms, and Filenames. Use Chinese for Descriptions, Explanations, and Reasoning."
    intent: "Ensure machine readability (English) while maintaining semantic nuance for native developers (Chinese)."

  - name: "Anchor Injection (锚点注入)"
    rule: "Every structural node (Domain, Feature, Component) in PRD MUST have a hidden HTML anchor: <!-- id: node_id -->."
    intent: "Enable automated linking between PRD intent and YAML structure."

  - name: "Single Source of Truth (唯一事实来源)"
    rule: "PRD defines Intent. YAML defines Structure. In case of conflict, update YAML to match PRD."
    intent: "Prevent drift and maintain spec-first discipline."
