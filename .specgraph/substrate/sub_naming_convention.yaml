  # Directory Naming Conventions
  
  To ensure consistency, the SpecGraph directory structure MUST follow these naming conventions:
  
  1. **Lowercase**: All directory names must be lowercase.
  2. **No Underscores**: Use concatenated words (e.g., `datamodels`, not `data_models`).
  3. **Plural**: Use plural nouns for collections (e.g., `features`, `components`).
  
  ## Standard Directories
  - `features/`: Feature specifications. Can be organized by domain (e.g., `features/dom_core/`).
  - `components/`: Component specifications.
  - `apis/`: API specifications.
  - `datamodels/`: Data model specifications.
  - `substrate/`: Substrate (rule) specifications.
  - `design/`: Design documents.
