# Feature Definition: Logging
# Part of Infrastructure (L0: dom_infra)

id: feat_logging
domain: dom_infra
source_anchor: "PRD.md#feat_logging"
intent: "Provide unified logging capabilities with structured output, level control, and multi-target support."

user_stories:
  - "As a developer, I want to create named loggers for each module to track module-specific logs."
  - "As an operator, I want to adjust log levels at runtime without restarting the application."
  - "As the system, I want to output logs in JSON format for log aggregation and analysis."
  - "As a developer, I want to send logs to multiple targets (console, file, remote) simultaneously."

workflow:
  - step: 1
    action: "Request logger by module name via get_logger(name)"
    output: "Named Logger instance"
  - step: 2
    action: "Logger inherits configuration from parent loggers"
    output: "Configured logger with appropriate handlers"
  - step: 3
    action: "Log messages with level, timestamp, and context"
    output: "Formatted log entries to configured targets"
